se64:**
  - Ability to encode a given string into Base64 format, understanding the encoding process.

### Basic Authentication

- **Definition:**
  - Understanding what Basic Authentication entails, a simple authentication scheme built into the HTTP protocol.
  
- **Authorization Header:**
  - Knowing how to construct and send the Authorization header in an HTTP request.
  
- **Process:**
  - Grasping the steps involved in Basic Authentication, including encoding the username and password in Base64 and # 0x01. Basic Authentication

## Learning Objectives

Upon completion of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts without relying on external resources:

### General

- **Authentication:**
  - Understanding the concept of authentication, which is the process of verifying the identity of a user, system, or entity.
  
- **Base64:**
  - Knowledge of Base64 encoding, a binary-to-text encoding scheme that represents binary data in an ASCII string format.
  
- **Encoding a String iincluding them in the Authorization header.
  
- **Security Considerations:**
  - Awareness of the limitations and potential security risks associated with Basic Authentication, such as the lack of encryption for credentials during transmission.

## Key Tasks

### 1. Authentication Fundamentals

- Define authentication and its importance in securing systems.
  
### 2. Base64 Encoding

- Explain the purpose of Base64 encoding and demonstrate the encoding of a sample string.

### 3. Basic Authentication Overview

- Define Basic Authentication and its usage in the context of HTTP.

### 4. Constructing Authorization Header

- Provide examples of constructing the Authorization header for Basic Authentication.

### 5. Security Awareness

- Discuss security considerations related to Basic Authentication, highlighting potential vulnerabilities.

## Evaluation Criteria

Your understanding will be assessed based on your ability to articulate the concepts outlined above and perform the practical tasks associated with Base64 encoding and Basic Authentication.

*Note: Avoid relying on external sources during the evaluation, as the objective is to demonstrate self-sufficiency in explaining and implementing the discussed concepts.*
