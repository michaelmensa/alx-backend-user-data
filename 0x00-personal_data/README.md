### 0x00. Personal Data

Personal data refers to any information that relates to an identified or identifiable individual. It includes a broad range of information, such as names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, social security numbers, and more. Handling personal data responsibly is crucial to ensure privacy and comply with data protection regulations.

### Learning Objectives

At the end of this projecow to Implement a Log Filter that will Obfuscate PII Fields

Implementing a log filter involves creating a mechanism to identify and obfuscate PII in log files. This is crucial for preventing accidental exposure of sensitive information in logs. Regular ext, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

#### Examples of Personally Identifiable Information (PII)

PII includes but is not limited to:

- **Full Name:** John Doe
- **Address:** 123 Main St, Cityville, State, Zip Code
- **Phone Number:** (555) 555-5555
- **Email Address:** john.doe@example.com
- **Social Security Number:** 123-45-6789
- **Date of Birth:** January 1, 1990

Understanding what constitutes PII is essential for safeguarding sensitive information.

#### Hpressions or custom algorithms can be used to identify and mask PII, replacing actual values with placeholders or hashes.

#### How to Encrypt a Password and Check the Validity of an Input Password

Encrypting passwords is vital for securing user credentials. Common techniques include using cryptographic hashing algorithms (e.g., bcrypt) to store passwords securely. Validating input passwords involves comparing the hashed input with the stored hashed password. If they match, the input password is valid.

#### How to Authenticate to a Database Using Environment Variables

Securing database credentials is essential to prevent unauthorized access. Storing sensitive information like database connection strings in environment variables adds an additional layer of security. The application can access these variables during runtime, ensuring that credentials are not hardcoded in the source code, reducing the risk of exposure.

These objectives aim to equip you with the knowledge and skills to handle personal data responsibly, implement secure logging practices, protect user passwords, and securely connect to databases.
